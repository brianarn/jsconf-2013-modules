# JSConf 2013 - Modules, what are they good for?

Have you ever started developing a simple application that only had one or two JavaScript files, and after a short time, you had over a dozen different scripts that you were loading, and if the sequence was even slightly off, things went awry? Everyone hits this point eventually, and the solution is modules!

In this session, we'll introduce what a module is and why it matters to you. There are many benefits to modular code development, and we'll cover those at an introductory level. We'll also take a look over the past, present, and future of modules in JavaScript. By the time we're done, you'll have a solid foundation to take away and put to use in your application!

Topics to be covered:

* Why modules matter: Write more easily managed, DRYer, testable code
* A history of module patterns: How people used to do this in JS
* What's hot now: CJS & AMD, including how to use each today
* The future: ES6 modules
